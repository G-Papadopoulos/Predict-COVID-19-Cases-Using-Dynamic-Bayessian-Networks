This work was developed as part of the course "ECE-189 Autonomous Agents".

It attempted to estimate the rate-of-change of true Covid-19 cases, based on data about the daily Covid-19 cases. A Hidden Markov Model was developed, where the rate-of-change was divided in three distinct classes: < −5%, > +5%, and ±5%.
